    # Name template of the recipe
    # Default to project name
    name: tfa

    # NOTE: make sure the url_template, the token and given repo (github or gitlab) owner and name are from the
    # same kind. We will probably unify this in the next major version like it is done with scoop.

    # GitHub/GitLab repository to push the formula to
    tap:
      owner: theykk
      name: homebrew-tap
      # Optionally a branch can be provided. If the branch does not exist, it
      # will be created. If no branch is listed, the default branch will be used
      branch: main
      # Optionally a token can be provided, if it differs from the token provided to GoReleaser
#      token: "{{ .Env.HOMEBREW_TAP_GITHUB_TOKEN }}"

    # Template for the url which is determined by the given Token (github or gitlab)
    # Default for github is "https://github.com/<repo_owner>/<repo_name>/releases/download/{{ .Tag }}/{{ .ArtifactName }}"
    # Default for gitlab is "https://gitlab.com/<repo_owner>/<repo_name>/-/releases/{{ .Tag }}/downloads/{{ .ArtifactName }}"
    # Default for gitea is "https://gitea.com/<repo_owner>/<repo_name>/releases/download/{{ .Tag }}/{{ .ArtifactName }}"
#    url_template: "http://github.com/theykk/tfa/releases/download/{{ .Tag }}/{{ .ArtifactName }}"

    # Allows you to set a custom download strategy. Note that you'll need
    # to implement the strategy and add it to your tap repository.
    # Example: https://docs.brew.sh/Formula-Cookbook#specifying-the-download-strategy-explicitly
    # Default is empty.
#    download_strategy: CurlDownloadStrategy

    # Allows you to add a custom require_relative at the top of the formula template
    # Default is empty
#    custom_require: custom_download_strategy

    # Git author used to commit to the repository.
    # Defaults are shown.
#    commit_author:
#      name: goreleaserbot
#      email: goreleaser@carlosbecker.com

    # The project name and current git tag are used in the format string.
    commit_msg_template: "Brew formula update for {{ .ProjectName }} version {{ .Tag }}"

    # Folder inside the repository to put the formula.
    # Default is the root folder.
    folder: Formula

    # Caveats for the user of your binary.
    # Default is empty.
    caveats: "tfa is 2fa code generator cli tool"

    # Your app's homepage.
    # Default is empty.
#    homepage: "https://example.com/"

    # Template of your app's description.
    # Default is empty.
    description: "tfa is 2fa code generator cli tool"

    # SPDX identifier of your app's license.
    # Default is empty.
    license: "MIT"

    # Setting this will prevent goreleaser to actually try to commit the updated
    # formula - instead, the formula file will be stored on the dist folder only,
    # leaving the responsibility of publishing it to the user.
    # If set to auto, the release will not be uploaded to the homebrew tap
    # in case there is an indicator for prerelease in the tag e.g. v1.0.0-rc1
    # Default is false.
#    skip_upload: true

    # Custom block for brew.
    # Can be used to specify alternate downloads for devel or head releases.
    # Default is empty.

    # Custom install script for brew.
    # Default is 'bin.install "program"'.
